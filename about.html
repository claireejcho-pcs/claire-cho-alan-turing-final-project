      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in London, England. From a young
        age, he showed exceptional aptitude in mathematics and science, paving
        the way for his groundbreaking contributions to computer science and
        artificial intelligence.
      </p>

      <h2>World War II and the Enigma Code</h2>
      <p>
        During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, the British
        codebreaking center. He played a pivotal role in cracking the German
        Enigma machine, which allowed the Allies to intercept and decode
        critical military communications. His work is credited with shortening
        the war and saving countless lives.
      </p>

      <h2>The Turing Machine</h2>
      <p>
        In 1936, Turing introduced the concept of the Turing Machine, a
        theoretical construct that laid the foundation for modern computer
        science. This device could simulate any computational process,
        effectively defining the limits of what can be computed.
      </p>

      <h2>The Turing Test</h2>
      <p>
        In 1950, Turing proposed the "Turing Test" as a measure of a machine's
        ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a
        human. This test remains a cornerstone of artificial intelligence
        research today.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy and Recognition</h2>
      <p>
        Despite his immense contributions, Turing faced persecution due to his
        sexuality. He was posthumously pardoned by the British government in
        2013, and his legacy is now celebrated worldwide. In 2021, he was
        honored by being featured on the UK £50 note.
